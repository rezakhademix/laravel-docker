# Dockerize Laravel App

A simplified Docker Compose workflow that sets up a Laravel network of containers for local Laravel development with Phpmyadmin.

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repo.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker compose up -d --build app`.

After that completes, follow the steps from the [src/README.md](src/README.md) file to get your Laravel project added in (or create a new blank Laravel app).

**Note**: Your MySQL database host name should be `mysql`, **note** `localhost`. The username and database should both be `homestead` with a password of `secret`.

The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

-   **nginx** - `:80`
-   **mysql** - `:3306`
-   **php** - `:9000`
-   **redis** - `:6379`
-   **phpmyadmin** - `:8081`

Three additional containers are included that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands _without_ having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

-   `docker compose run --rm composer update`
-   `docker compose run --rm npm run dev`
-   `docker compose run --rm artisan migrate`

## Persistent MySQL Storage

By default, whenever you bring down the Docker network, your MySQL data will be removed after the containers are destroyed. If you would like to have persistent data that remains after bringing containers down and back up, do the following:

1. Create a `mysql` folder in the project root, alongside the `nginx` and `src` folders.
2. Under the mysql service in your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following lines:

```
volumes:
  - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```

1. If you want to initialize database data with a sql file you should create a `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` folder inside `./mysql` and put your `db.sql` file into it.

2. Samething abour redis container so you should decide about redis persistent data:(optional)

#### another way of doing the 2,3:

```
volumes:
  mysql:
    driver: local
  redis:
    driver: local
```

## docker exec container

Access container as interactive shell and see output:

```
docker exec -it <container id> sh
```

Tip: You may use /bin/bash or just bash so after installing bash, you should inspect your image to understand CMD part and change current
option to whatever you want. For this purpose run:

```
docker inspect [imageID]
```

## Usage in Production

Tip: Don't forget to install and configure opcache

While I originally created this template for local development, it's robust enough to be used in basic Laravel application deployments. The biggest recommendation would be to ensure that HTTPS is enabled by making additions to the `nginx/default.conf` file and utilizing something like [Let's Encrypt](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt) to produce an SSL certificate.

## Compiling Assets

This configuration should be able to compile assets with both [laravel mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). In order to get started, you first need to add ` --host 0.0.0.0` after the end of your relevant dev command in `package.json`. So for example, with a Laravel project using Vite, you should see:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0",
  "build": "vite build"
},
```

Then, run the following commands to install your dependencies and start the dev server:

-   `docker compose run --rm npm install`
-   `docker compose run --rm --service-ports npm run dev`

After that, you should be able to use `@vite` directives to enable hot-module reloading on your local Laravel application.

Want to build for production? Simply run `docker compose run --rm npm run build`.
